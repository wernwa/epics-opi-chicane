START GUI

There are three main starter scripts.

./start-cli.sh

starts a command line interface inside ipython. The user is able to call functions and look at variables. This setting is mainly for debugging purpose.

./start-quadruplett-gui.sh
./start-triplett-gui.sh

The other two starter scripts starts the gui with the  quadruplett or the triplett combination of the magnets.


DEPENDENCIES
    python 2.7.5
    pyepics (http://pyepics.github.io/pyepics/installation.html)
    python-numpy
    python-scipy
    python-wxgtk2.8
    python-matplotlib


FILE STRUCTURE

The cli directory contains non gui python files.
Experiment.py       contains all EPICs PV variables
epics_device.py     class for all PVs around a power supply
Magnet.py           class for all PVs for one Magnet (voltage,current,temperature)
PV_CONN.py          helper class for PV with a connection/disconnection guard

The gui directory contains all gui related classes
window.py           main Frame class
DataPanel.py        The panel displaying all current magnet data (current, voltage, k/alpha, temperature)
TabOverview.py      The first Tab that shows the chicane arangement
TabMagnProperties.py    Allows the user to change the PVs of a magnet
TabStripChart.py    main strip chart class for displaying values over time
TabStripChartTemp.py    
TabStripChartVolt.py    
TabStripChartCurr.py    derived classes from TabStripChart class to display temperature, voltage and current

The magnet-data directory contains curves data k-I and alpha-I of the magnets. The files

q1-k-I.data
q2-k-I.data
q3-k-I.data
q4-k-I.data
q5-k-I.data
q6-k-I.data
q7-k-I.data
d1-alpha-I.data
d2-alpha-I.data

are expected from the gui to be there at start time. The format of each file are two or more columns separated by white-spaces. The first column is always the current (I[A]) and the second is the y-value (k for quadrupoles or angle for dipoles). There can be comment lines starting with '#'.
